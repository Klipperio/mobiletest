Mobile test
===========

We @ (Klipper.io)[http://klipper.io] have been trying to build pieces that accelerate the mobile experience. In the quest we managed to figure there are very few tools that actually let you test mobile web performace. So, we decided to build out a neat little simulator for mobile web using Meteor.js!

This uses Meteor.js and phantomas to achieve our intended goal of displaying all the metrics related to page performance.

This is a meteorjs application that we use to compare our setups speed versus regular connections. Uses PhantomJS (Webkit) to gather the various metrics that we need to compare on. So we effectively assume that you have some sort of a web proxy/middleware like us which you need to configure. 

Feel free to reach out!
